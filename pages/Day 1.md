# Day 1

## Camp Rules ❤
1. Stay muted unless your code sensei grants permission; raise your hand to ask questions.
1. Keep your webcam on your face so your code sensei can notice when you raise your hand.
1. In general, be respectful to your fellow campers and to your code sensei ☺.

See you tomorrow for day 2!
